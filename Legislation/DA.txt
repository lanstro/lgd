	(3)	Despite subsection (1), the dutiable value of a lease referred to in section 10(1)(ab) that is the subject of a dutiable transaction is the greater of-
	(a)	any consideration (being the amount of a monetary consideration or the value of a non-monetary consideration) other than rent reserved that is paid or agreed to be paid; and
	(b)	the unencumbered value of the land that is subject to the lease.
	21	What is the consideration for the transfer of dutiable property?

	(b)	a copy of the contract with the transferee for the construction or refurbishment; and
	(c)	a statutory declaration in the approved form by the transferor as to (but not limited to) whether or not the transferor has entered into any agreement with the transferee in respect of works (other than construction or refurbishment) to be undertaken in relation to the land or the lot before the transfer; and

	(2)	The Commissioner may publish different percentage amounts for different classes of buildings or refurbishments.

	(b)	that statutory declaration is incorrect-
the transferor is jointly and severally liable with the transferee for any additional duty payable on the transfer and any penalty or interest.
	22	What is the unencumbered value of dutiable property?
	(1)	The unencumbered value of dutiable property is the amount for which the property might reasonably have been sold in the open market-
	(a)	in the case of a transfer of dutiable property on a sale of the property-at the time the contract of sale was entered into;
	(b)	in any other case-at the time the dutiable transaction occurred-
free from any encumbrance to which the property was subject at that time.
	(2)	In determining the amount for which land or goods might reasonably have been sold free from encumbrances, there must be disregarded subject to subsection (3), any interest, agreement or arrangement (other than an encumbrance) granted or made in respect of the land or goods, that has the effect of reducing the value of the land or goods.
	(2A)	A reference in subsection (2) to an interest includes a reference to an equitable interest that-
	(a)	was created before the time of the transfer of the land or goods; and
	(b)	is in existence at that time.
	(3)	An interest, agreement or arrangement referred to in subsection (2) is not to be disregarded if the Commissioner is satisfied that it was not granted or made as a part of an arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of reducing the duty otherwise payable on the transfer of the land or goods.
	(4)	In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the purposes of subsection (3), the Commissioner may have regard to-

	(c)	whether there is any commercial efficacy to the granting of the interest or the making of the agreement or arrangement other than to reduce duty; and
	(d)	any other matters he or she considers relevant.
	(5)	In computing for the purposes of this Chapter the unencumbered value of any marketable securities of a company, there must be disregarded any provision in the constitution of the company which, or the operation of which, restricts or would restrict the sale or disposition or reduces or would reduce the unencumbered value of the marketable securities, and the marketable securities are to be valued as if no such provision existed.
	(6)	Despite anything to the contrary in this section, the Commissioner may adopt as the unencumbered value of any marketable securities of a company the net benefit that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the holder of the marketable securities would receive after payment of all income taxes in respect of the marketable securities in the event of the company being voluntarily wound up at the time the dutiable transaction occurred, whether or not any such winding up was intended or contemplated at that time.
	22A	Tenant's fixtures to be included in the value of land
	(1)	In determining for the purposes of this Part the unencumbered value of land, the value of any tenant's fixtures on that land is to be included in that value.

	(b)	business goods relating to that land are sold to another person (the goods transferee) under a contract of sale of goods, or a contract of sale of a business; and
	(c)	the land transferee and the goods transferee are not associated persons; and
	(d)	the Commissioner is satisfied that the contract of sale referred to in paragraph (a) and the contract of sale referred to in paragraph (b) are not substantially one transaction; and
	(e)	at least one of the contracts of sale referred to in paragraph (a) and (b) is conditional on the other.
	(2)	If this section applies-
	(a)	in determining the unencumbered value of the land transferred to the land transferee, the value of the business goods is to be disregarded;
	(b)	nothing in section 24 applies to the transfer.
	(3)	However, if at any subsequent time the business goods or any of them are transferred to the land transferee or to an associated person of the land transferee, the value of the business goods transferred is deemed to have formed part of the value of the land and duty payable under this Part is to be assessed or reassessed on that basis.
	(4)	Any duty payable because of the operation of subsection (3) is payable within 30 days after the date on which the business goods were transferred to the land transferee.
	(5)	Subsection (3) does not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that-
	(a)	the land transferee acquired the business goods at least 3 years after acquiring the land; and

	(a)	those assets were transferred to the ownership or control of the transferee of the marketable securities or to an associated person of the transferee before the transfer of the marketable securities; and
	(b)	those assets are necessary for the continuing operation of the company after the transfer of the marketable securities; and
	(c)	the value of the marketable securities was reduced following the transfer of ownership or control of assets because the proceeds of that transfer were not retained by the company.
	(2)	In determining whether assets are necessary for the continuing operation of a company the Commissioner may take into account-
	(a)	whether or not the assets were removed from the company's premises after the transfer of ownership or control;
	(b)	whether or not the assets continued to be used by the company under an arrangement with the transferee.
	(3)	This section does not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that the transfer of ownership or control of assets-
	(a)	was part of the normal business operations of the transferee; or
	(b)	was not part of a scheme or arrangement devised for the principal purpose of minimising duty chargeable under this Chapter on the transfer of marketable securities.

	(2A)	Dutiable transactions are not to be aggregated under this section if the Commissioner is satisfied that-
	(a)	each item or part of dutiable property to which the arrangement referred to in subsection (1) relates is-

	(b)	in any other case-the time the dutiable transaction relating to the item or part occurred.
	(4)	The amount of duty payable in accordance with this section is to be reduced by the amount of any ad valorem duty paid on a prior dutiable transaction that is, or prior dutiable transactions that are, aggregated in accordance with this section.
	(5)	Duty may be apportioned to the instruments effecting or evidencing the dutiable transactions, or may be charged in accordance with section 17, as determined by the Commissioner.
	(6)	A transferee to whom this section applies must disclose to the Commissioner, in writing, at or before the time at which an instrument or statement relating to the dutiable transactions is lodged for stamping, details known to the transferee of-

An exemption in respect of $300 000 of the aggregated dutiable value of the dutiable transactions is first applied to the dutiable transaction with the lowest dutiable value, and then to the dutiable transaction with the next lowest dutiable value.  This means that a full exemption from duty applies to Transaction A and a partial exemption applies to Transaction B, being an exemption in respect of $100 000 of the dutiable value of Transaction B.  For the purposes of assessing the young farmer's duty liability under subsection (1)(c), Transaction B is taken to have a dutiable value of $200 000.

	(1)	A person acquires an interest in a land rich landholder if the person obtains an interest beneficially, including if the person's interest increases, in the landholder regardless of how it is obtained or increased.
	(2)	Without limiting subsection (1), a person may acquire an interest in a land rich landholder in the following ways-
	(a)	the purchase, gift, allotment or issue of a unit or share;
	(b)	the cancellation, redemption or surrender of a unit or share;
	(c)	the abrogation or alteration of a right pertaining to a unit or share;
	(d)	the payment of an amount owing for a unit or share.
	(2AA)	Without limiting subsection (1), a person is taken to obtain an interest beneficially if the person obtains the interest as trustee of a trust.
	(2AB)	A trustee who holds or acquires an interest in a land rich landholder is to be treated as a separate person in respect of each trust of which the trustee is a trustee and the personal capacity of the trustee, if any.
	(2A)	In addition to subsection (1), a person who holds an interest in a land rich landholder acquires an interest in the landholder if the capacity in which the person holds the interest changes.




	(2C)	An acquisition of an interest referred to in subsection (2A) is to be treated as a separate acquisition from existing interests held by the acquirer or any other acquisition of an interest in a land rich landholder unless those acquisitions are made on behalf of the same person or associated persons.
	(3)	To remove any doubt, it is declared that an acquisition by way of transfer of units or shares is not necessary to acquire an interest in a land rich landholder.
Division 3-Charging of duty
	78	When does a liability for duty arise?
A liability for duty charged by this Part arises when a relevant acquisition is made.
	79	What is a relevant acquisition?
	(1)	For the purposes of this Part, a person makes a relevant acquisition if-
	(a)	the person acquires an interest in a land rich landholder-
	(i)	that is of itself a significant interest in the landholder; or
	(ii)	that, when aggregated with other interests in the landholder acquired by the person or an associated person of the person (or both) on the same day or within the 3 years preceding the acquisition of the interest, results in an aggregation that amounts to a significant interest in the landholder; or
	(iii)	that, when aggregated with other interests in the landholder acquired by the person as set out in subparagraph (ii) or interests acquired by any person in an associated transaction (or both) on the same day or within the 3 years preceding the acquisition of the interest, results in an aggregation that amounts to a significant interest in the landholder; or
	(b)	after an interest referred to in paragraph (a) was acquired in respect of which duty was charged, the person or an associated person acquires a further interest in the landholder.
Note
Associated person is defined in section 3.  Associated transaction is defined in subsection (9).


	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1)(a)(ii) or (b), a person is not an associated person of another person if the Commissioner is satisfied that the interests of the persons-
	(a)	were acquired, and will be used, independently; and
	(b)	were not acquired, and will not be used, for a common purpose.
	(3)	Subsection (2) does not apply if the persons are associated persons because they are related bodies corporate.
	(3A)	For the purposes of this Part, persons in their capacity as qualifying investors of a wholesale unit trust scheme are taken not to be associated persons of other qualifying investors in relation to the scheme.
	(4)	For the purposes of subsection (1), if-
	(a)	a person acquires an interest in a land rich landholder that is not a significant interest (the first acquisition); and
	(b)	the person or an associated person (or both) acquire another interest in the landholder (the subsequent acquisition) later than 3 years after the first acquisition but as a result of an arrangement entered into within those 3 years-
the first acquisition, and any further acquisitions by the person or an associated person (or both) after the first acquisition but before the subsequent acquisition, are taken to have been made on the same day as the subsequent acquisition.
	(5)	Despite anything to the contrary in this Part, if a person within a 3 year period acquires, directly or indirectly, control over a land rich landholder, other than by a relevant acquisition dutiable under this Part, then on the acquiring of that control the person is taken, for the purposes of this Part to have made a relevant acquisition of an interest in the landholder of-
	(a)	100%; or
	(b)	the lesser percentage determined by the Commissioner to be appropriate in the circumstances.
	(6)	For the purposes of subsection (5), a person acquires control over a landholder if they acquire the capacity to determine or influence the outcome of decisions about the landholder's financial and operating policies, taking into account-
	(a)	the practical influence the person can exert in addition to any rights the person can enforce; and
	(b)	any practice or behaviour affecting the landholder's financial or operating policies (even if that practice or pattern of behaviour involves the breach of an agreement or a breach of trust).
	(7)	Subsection (5) applies regardless of interests held by any other person in the landholder.
	(8)	An interest in a landholder is not counted for the purposes of this section if-
	(a)	the interest was acquired before 15 November 1987; or
	(b)	the interest was acquired at a time when the landholder did not hold land in Victoria.




	(9)	In this section-
associated transaction in relation to the acquisition of an interest in a landholder by a person, means an acquisition of an interest in the landholder by another person in circumstances in which-
	(a)	those persons are acting in concert; or
	(b)	the acquisitions form, evidence, give effect to or arise from substantially one arrangement, one transaction or one series of transactions.
	80	Acquisition statements


	(1)	If a relevant acquisition is made, either or both the person who made the acquisition and the landholder (or, if the landholder is a unit trust scheme, the trustee of the landholder) must prepare a statement (an acquisition statement) and lodge it with the Commissioner within 30 days after the date of the relevant acquisition.
	(2)	The acquisition statement is to be prepared in an approved form and must contain the following information-
	(a)	the name and address of the person who has acquired the interest;
	(b)	in relation to each interest acquired, the date on which it was acquired and whether it is an exempt acquisition;
	(c)	if the relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the interests of associated persons, particulars of the interests acquired by the person and any associated persons on the date of the relevant acquisition and within 3 years before that date;
	(d)	if the relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the interests of persons who acquired interests because of section 79(1)(a)(iii), particulars of the interests acquired by the person and all other persons involved;
	(e)	particulars of the total interest of the person and any associated person in the landholder at that date;
	(f)	the unencumbered value of all land holdings in Victoria of the landholder as at the date of the relevant acquisition;
	(g)	the unencumbered value of the property of the landholder at the date of the relevant acquisition;
	(h)	any other information the Commissioner may require.
Note
In ascertaining whether or not a liability to lodge a statement under this section exists, it is necessary to have regard to provisions of this Part that deal with-
* acquisition generally (section 77); and
* acquisitions that are exempt from the operation of this Part (section 85).
There is joint and several liability for the duty as between the person lodging the acquisition statement and others-see section 82.
	81	When must duty be paid?
A tax default does not occur for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 if duty is paid within 30 days after the liability to pay the duty arises.


	82	Who is liable to pay the duty?
	(1)	The following are jointly and severally liable to pay duty chargeable under this Part-
	(a)	the person who makes the relevant acquisition; and
	(b)	the landholder or, if the landholder is a unit trust scheme, the trustee of the landholder; and
	(c)	if the relevant acquisition results from an aggregation of the interests of the person referred to in paragraph (a) and other persons-each of those other persons.
	(2)	A person, other than a person referred to in subsection (1)(c), may recover as a debt from the person who made the relevant acquisition or a person referred to in subsection (1)(c) the amount of any duty chargeable under this Part and any penalty paid by the first person in respect of that duty.
	83	How duty is charged on relevant acquisitions
	(1)	Duty is chargeable, at the rate specified under this Act for a transfer of dutiable property, on the amount calculated by multiplying the unencumbered value of all land holdings of the landholder in Victoria (calculated at the date of acquisition of the interest acquired) by the proportion of that value represented by the interest acquired in the relevant acquisition.
	(1A)	If a relevant acquisition results from the aggregation of the interests acquired by-
	(a)	a person; or



	(b)	an associated person; or
	(c)	any other person in an associated transaction-
a reference in subsection (1) to the interest acquired includes a reference to any interest acquired by those persons on the same day.
	(1B)	If the relevant acquisition is the acquisition of an interest by a person that amounts to a significant interest in the landholder when aggregated with other interests acquired by-
	(a)	the person; or
	(b)	an associated person; or
	(c)	any other person in an associated transaction-
during the 3 years preceding the acquisition of the interest by the person, duty is chargeable at the rate specified under this Act for a transfer of dutiable property on the aggregate of the amounts separately calculated in accordance with subsection (1) in respect of each of the interests that comprise the relevant acquisition.
	(2)	If the relevant acquisition is the acquisition of a further interest as described in section 79(1)(b), duty is chargeable as follows-
	(a)	first, a calculation is to be made of the duty that would be chargeable under subsection (1) if the further interest were to be added to all interests referred to in section 79(1)(a) and (b) (the prior interests);
	(b)	secondly, a calculation is to be made of the duty chargeable under subsection (1) in respect of the prior interests;

	(c)	the duty chargeable on the acquisition of the further interest is the amount calculated under paragraph (a) less the amount calculated under paragraph (b).
	(3)	Duty payable under this section is to be reduced by an amount (if any) calculated in accordance with the following formula-

where-
	A	is the unencumbered value of the land holdings in Victoria of the landholder at the time the relevant acquisition was made; and
	B	is the unencumbered value of all property of the landholder at that time; and
	C	is the sum of-
	(a)	the duty under this Act paid or payable at the rate applicable to transactions involving marketable securities, in respect of-
	(i)	a dutiable transaction in relation to the units or shares; or
	(ii)	a capital reduction or a rights alteration under Part 3 by which an interest in the landholder was acquired; or
	(iii)	an allotment under Part 4 by which an interest in the landholder was acquired; and
	(b)	any duty of a like nature so paid or payable under a law of another Australian jurisdiction.

	(4)	This section is subject to Division 4.
Note
In ascertaining the duty payable under this section, it is necessary to have regard to provisions of Division 4 of this Part that deal with-
* rescission of agreements for the sale or transfer of land and other property (section 88); and
* acquisitions for securing financial accommodation (section 89).
	(5)	In this section-
associated transaction has the same meaning as in section 79.
	84	Phasing-in of duty
If the unencumbered value of land holdings in Victoria of a landholder exceeds $1 000 000 but does not exceed $1 500 000, the duty chargeable under this Part is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula-

where-
	A	is the unencumbered value of the land holdings in Victoria of the landholder at the time the relevant acquisition was made; and
	B	is the duty that, apart from this section, would be chargeable under this Part.






Division 4-Exemptions, concessions and supplemental provisions
	85	Exemptions
	(1)	An acquisition by a person of an interest in a landholder is an exempt acquisition-
	(a)	if the means by which the person acquired the interest would have resulted in no ad valorem duty being payable under Chapter 2 had the subject of the acquisition been a transfer of the land of the landholder to the person; or
	(b)	if the interest was acquired in the person's capacity as-
	(i)	a receiver or trustee in bankruptcy; or
	(ii)	a liquidator; or
	(iii)	an executor or administrator of the estate of a deceased person; or
	(c)	if the interest was acquired solely as the result of the making of a compromise or arrangement with the landholder's creditors under Part 5.1 of the Corporations Act that has been approved by the court, not being a compromise or arrangement that the Commissioner is satisfied was made with the intention of defeating the operation of this Part; or
	(d)	if the interest concerned is acquired solely from a pro rata increase in the interests of all unit holders or shareholders.
	(2)	An acquisition by a person of an interest in a landholder is an exempt acquisition if the Commissioner so determines, being satisfied that the application of this Part to the acquisition in the particular case would not be just and reasonable.
	86	Maximisation of entitlements on distribution of property
	(1)	This section applies to any calculation, for the purposes of this Part, of the entitlement of a person (the interested person) to participate in a distribution of the property of a landholder, whether on a winding up, a vesting of trust property or otherwise.
	(2)	A calculation is to be made based, firstly, on a distribution carried out in accordance with the constitution of the landholder, and with any law relevant to the distribution, as in force at the time of distribution, and the entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.
	(3)	Next, a calculation is to be made based on a distribution carried out after the interested person, and any other person whom the interested person has power to direct with respect to such a distribution or who is, in relation to the interested person, an associated person, had exercised all powers and discretions exercisable by them-
	(a)	to effect or compel an alteration to the constitution of the landholder; and
	(b)	to vary the rights conferred by units or shares in the landholder; and
	(c)	to effect or compel the substitution or replacement of units or shares in the landholder with other units or shares in it-
in such a manner as would maximise the value of the entitlement, and the entitlement of the interested person is to be evaluated accordingly.
	(4)	The results obtained by an evaluation of the interested person's entitlement in accordance with subsections (2) and (3) are then to be compared, and whichever evaluation results in a greater entitlement is the correct evaluation, for the purposes of this Part, of the entitlement, unless the Commissioner, being satisfied that the application of this subsection in the particular case would be inequitable, determines otherwise.
	(5)	A reference in this section to the constitution of a landholder is a reference, if the landholder is a unit trust scheme, to the trust deed or other document that contains the rules of the trust.
	87	Valuation of property
	(1)	The provisions of this Act for ascertaining the value of transfers chargeable with ad valorem duty apply in the same way to an acquisition statement under this Part and the value of land holdings mentioned in it.
	(2)	In determining the value of land holdings under this Part, any arrangement made in respect of the land holdings that has the effect of reducing the value is to be disregarded, subject to subsection (3).
	(3)	An arrangement is not to be disregarded if the Commissioner is satisfied that the arrangement was not made as part of an arrangement or scheme with a collateral purpose of reducing the duty otherwise payable in relation to the relevant acquisition.
	(4)	In considering whether or not he or she is satisfied for the purposes of subsection (3), the Commissioner may have regard to-
	(a)	the duration of the arrangement before the relevant acquisition; and
	(b)	whether the arrangement has been made with an associated person; and
	(c)	whether there is any commercial efficacy to the making of the arrangement other than to reduce duty; and
	(d)	any other matters the Commissioner considers relevant.
	88	Agreements for sale, transfer or purchase of land and other property
	(1)	If-
	(a)	at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a land rich landholder that necessitates the lodgement of an acquisition statement under Division 3, the landholder was the vendor under an uncompleted agreement for the sale or transfer of land; and
	(b)	the agreement is subsequently completed-
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the land the subject of the agreement was not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding of the landholder.
	(2)	If-
	(a)	at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a land rich landholder that necessitates the lodgement of an acquisition statement under Division 3, the landholder was the purchaser under an uncompleted agreement for the purchase of property other than land; and
	(b)	the agreement is subsequently completed-
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the property the subject of the agreement was, at the time of the acquisition concerned, property of the landholder.

	(3)	If-
	(a)	at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a land rich landholder that requires the lodgement by any person of an acquisition statement under Division 3, the landholder was the purchaser under an uncompleted agreement for the sale or transfer of land; and
	(b)	the agreement is subsequently rescinded, annulled or otherwise terminated without completion-
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the land the subject of the agreement was not, at the time of the acquisition concerned, a land holding of the landholder.
	(4)	If-
	(a)	at the time of acquisition of an interest by any person in a land rich landholder that requires the lodgement by any person of an acquisition statement under Division 3, the landholder was the vendor under an uncompleted agreement for the sale of property other than land; and
	(b)	the agreement is subsequently rescinded, annulled or otherwise terminated without completion-
the Commissioner is to determine whether or not duty is payable, and must assess or reassess the statement accordingly, as though the property the subject of the agreement was, at the time of the acquisition concerned, property of the landholder.
	(5)	In this section, a reference to a landholder includes a reference to a linked entity of the landholder and, in the case of a landholder that is a unit trust scheme, also includes a reference to a trustee of the landholder.
	(6)	For the purposes of this section-
	(a)	a reference to a vendor includes a reference to a person who, at the time of a relevant acquisition, was the grantee of a put option or grantor of a call option;
	(b)	a reference to a purchaser includes a reference to a person who, at the time of a relevant acquisition-
	(i)	held a transfer right (within the meaning of Part 4A of Chapter 2); or
	(ii)	was the grantor of a put option or grantee of a call option;
	(c)	a reference to an uncompleted agreement includes a reference to an arrangement that includes both a put option and a call option.
	89	Duty concession acquisitions securing financial accommodation
	(1)	Except as provided by subsection (2), an acquisition statement is not chargeable with duty insofar as it relates to an acquisition if-
	(a)	the person lodging the statement informs the Commissioner at the time of lodgement that the acquisition is effected for the purpose of securing financial accommodation; and
	(b)	the Commissioner is satisfied that the acquisition is effected for that purpose.
	(2)	The statement is chargeable with duty at the expiration of the period of 5 years after the date of the acquisition (or such longer period as may be determined by the Commissioner in the particular case) if the interest concerned is not-
	(a)	re-acquired by the person from whom it was acquired; or
	(b)	in the case of an acquisition by way of mortgage, conveyed by the mortgagee to a third person in exercise of the mortgagee's power of sale, within that period (or that longer period).
	(3)	The re-acquisition by a person of the interest concerned is not a relevant acquisition for the purposes of this Part.
	89A	Re-purchase facilities-widely held trusts
	(1)	This section applies if-
	(a)	the trustee of a unit trust scheme that is a widely held trust redeems any units in the trust; and
	(b)	the redemption is done for the purpose of re-issuing or re-offering the units for sale; and
	(c)	as a result of the redemption, the scheme would, but for this section, cease to be a widely held trust because a unit holder, individually or together with any associated person, is beneficially entitled to more than 20% of the units in the trust.
	(2)	For a period of 30 days beginning on and including the day on which the redemption occurs, the definition of widely held trust in section 3(1) applies to the unit trust scheme as if a reference in paragraph (c)(ii) of that definition to 20% were a reference to 25%.
	(3)	However, if at the end of the 30-day period beginning on and including the day on which the redemption occurs, a unit holder, individually or together with any associated person, is beneficially entitled to more than 20% of the units in the unit trust scheme-
	(a)	the definition of widely held trust in section 3(1) is taken to have applied to the unit trust scheme during that period as if subsection (2) had not been enacted; and
	(b)	the Commissioner must determine whether any duty is chargeable under this Act as a result of the operation of paragraph (a) and if so, must assess that duty; and
	(c)	a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 if the whole of any duty assessed under paragraph (b) is not paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after liability for the duty arose.
	89B	Disqualifying circumstances for certain unit trust schemes

	(1)	In this section, disqualifying circumstance means-
	(a)	a circumstance that causes a unit trust scheme that is registered under Division 7 to cease to meet the relevant criteria for registration; or
	(b)	subject to subsection (1A), the failure by a unit trust scheme that is registered under Division 7 to meet a condition of registration, or the contravention of a condition of registration by a unit trust scheme or the trustee of the scheme.
	(1A)	A failure or contravention referred to in subsection (1)(b) is not a disqualifying circumstance if the Commissioner so determines, being satisfied that the application of this section to the unit trust scheme in the particular case would not be just or reasonable.
	(2)	If a disqualifying circumstance occurs in respect of a unit trust scheme-
	(a)	the trustee of the unit trust scheme must give the Commissioner notice of the disqualifying circumstance within 28 days after it occurs; and
	(b)	the unit trust scheme is taken to have been a private unit trust scheme from and including the relevant date; and
	(c)	if an acquisition of a significant interest was made on or after the relevant date it becomes a relevant acquisition; and
	(d)	the Commissioner must make an assessment of duty chargeable under this Act as a result of the operation of paragraphs (b) and (c); and
	(e)	a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 if the whole of any duty assessed under paragraph (d) is not paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after liability for the duty arose.
	(3)	The trustee of a unit trust scheme must not fail to comply with subsection (2)(a).
Penalty: 10 penalty units.
	(4)	If-
	(a)	a disqualifying circumstance occurs in relation to a unit trust scheme; and
	(b)	the trustee of the unit trust scheme fails to comply with subsection (2)(a); and

	(c)	duty is assessed under this Part as a result of the disqualifying circumstance-
the trustee of the unit trust scheme is liable to pay to the Commissioner, by way of penalty, an amount equal to double the amount of duty assessed as a result of the disqualifying circumstance, less any amount of duty that the trustee or any other person did pay.
	(5)	A penalty imposed by subsection (4) is in addition to any penalty imposed for contravention of subsection (3) by the trustee.
	(6)	The Commissioner, in such circumstances as the Commissioner considers appropriate, may remit the penalty imposed by subsection (4) by any amount.
	(7)	In this section-
relevant date means-
	(a)	if the disqualifying circumstance is a circumstance that causes a registered imminent public unit trust scheme to cease to meet the criteria set out in section 89M(2)(a)-the date on which the 12 month period referred to in that section began;
	(b)	if the disqualifying circumstance is a circumstance that causes a registered imminent wholesale unit trust scheme to cease to meet the criteria set out in section 89P(2)(a)-the date on which the 12 month period referred to in that section began;
	(c)	in any other case-the date the disqualifying circumstance occurred.
	89C	Sale of private unit trust scheme through conversion to public unit trust scheme
	(1)	This section applies if-
	(a)	a land rich landholder that is a private unit trust scheme becomes, through whatever means, a public unit trust scheme; and
	(b)	under an agreement or arrangement made before the scheme becomes a public unit trust scheme-
	(i)	a payment is made to or on behalf of a person who, or persons who together, held units representing an interest of at least 20% in the private unit trust scheme immediately before the agreement or arrangement was made; or
	(ii)	a person referred to in subparagraph (i) ceases to hold an interest in the public unit trust scheme that is relevant to an interest of at least 20% in the private unit trust scheme immediately before the agreement or arrangement was made (whether as a consequence of a payment referred to in that subparagraph or otherwise).
	(2)	On a payment referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) being made or on a person ceasing to hold an interest referred to in subsection (1)(b)(ii)-
	(a)	the unit trust scheme is taken, for the purposes of this Part, to have always been a private unit trust scheme; and
	(b)	all acquisitions of the interests of persons referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i) are taken to have been a single acquisition of an interest in the private unit trust scheme; and
	(c)	the Commissioner must make an assessment of duty chargeable under this Act (if any) as a result of the operation of paragraphs (a) and (b); and
	(d)	a tax default occurs for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 if the whole of any duty assessed under paragraph (c) is not paid to the Commissioner within 30 days after liability for the duty arose.
	(3)	In determining whether a person has a significant interest in the unit trust scheme, the only interests to be taken into account are those that existed immediately before the agreement or arrangement referred to in subsection (1)(b) was made.
	(4)	Despite anything to the contrary in Division 1 of Part 2 of Chapter 11, nothing to which this section applies is capable of being an eligible transaction for the purposes of that Division.

	(a)	a transitional acquisition; and

	(b)	who, individually or together with any associated person, is beneficially entitled to not more than 20% of the units in the scheme;
transitional acquisition means an acquisition by a person of units in a unit trust scheme that, immediately before the acquisition was a public unit trust scheme-
	(a)	made in response to or in accordance with an offer or arrangement; and
	(b)	that by itself, or when aggregated with acquisitions made by an associated person, results in the unit trust scheme becoming a private unit trust scheme.


	(2)	Despite anything to the contrary in section 3, for the purposes of this Division (and for determining whether duty is payable under this Part on an acquisition referred to in this Division) a public unit trust scheme that is a listed trust is deemed to become a private unit trust scheme when the number of relevant unitholders falls below 300.
	(3)	Nothing in this Division applies to a public unit trust scheme that is a listed trust all the units in which have been listed for quotation on the ASX or an exchange of the World Federation of Exchanges for 3 years or more.
	89E	When public unit trust scheme becomes a private unit trust scheme
	(1)	Subject to subsection (2), if, as a result of the acquisition of one or more units in a unit trust scheme that, immediately before the acquisition, was a public unit trust scheme, the scheme becomes a private unit trust scheme, the scheme is taken to have become a private unit trust scheme immediately before that acquisition.
	(2)	If a transitional acquisition in a public unit trust scheme is made, the scheme is taken to have become a private unit trust scheme immediately before the first of the aggregated acquisitions.
	(3)	In determining for the purposes of this Part whether a person makes a relevant acquisition, the aggregated acquisitions are together taken to form one acquisition made by the person or an associated person at the time of the last of those acquisitions.



	(4)	If the Commissioner is satisfied that an acquisition that would otherwise form part of the aggregated acquisitions is not made for a common purpose, the Commissioner is to treat that acquisition as not forming part of the aggregated acquisitions.
	89F	Interstate security duty
	(1)	If interstate security duty has been paid in respect of any acquisition forming part of the aggregated acquisitions, the amount of the aggregated duty that is attributable to the aggregated acquisitions is to be reduced by the same proportion of the interstate security duty as the value of the land holdings of the landholder in Victoria bears to the aggregate value of all land holdings of the landholder.
	(2)	In subsection (1)-
aggregated duty means duty that is chargeable under this Part because of section 89E in respect of the aggregated acquisitions;

	(3)	If goods are solely or predominantly used or, in the case of a motor vehicle, are registered in a place other than the place advised by the hirer in a statement referred to in subsection (1), the Commissioner may assess or reassess the duty payable according to the actual place of sole or predominant use of the goods or, in the case of a motor vehicle, the place of its registration.
	(4)	A failure to pay duty on the hire of goods by a person who hires out the goods in due reliance on a statement referred to in subsection (1), is not a tax default for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997, if the duty is paid within 3 months after the issue of a notice of assessment of the duty.
	(5)	A hirer who knowingly falsely represents to the person who hires out goods (or to any person acting for that person) that the goods will be used solely or predominantly outside Victoria is guilty of an offence.

CHAPTER 7-MORTGAGES
PART 1-INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
	148	Imposition of duty
This Chapter charges duty on instruments that are mortgages. Duty chargeable under this Chapter is called mortgage duty.
	148A	Mortgage duty abolished from July 2004
Despite anything to the contrary in this Chapter, mortgage duty is not chargeable-
	(a)	on a mortgage first executed, or that first affects property in Victoria, on or after 1 July 2004; or
	(b)	in respect of an advance or further advance on or after 1 July 2004 under a mortgage first executed, or that first affects property in Victoria, before that day.
	149	What is a mortgage?
For the purposes of this Chapter, an instrument is a mortgage if it is-
	(a)	a security by way of mortgage or charge over property wholly or partly in Victoria at the liability date; or
	(b)	a security by way of a transfer of property wholly or partly in Victoria held in trust to be sold or otherwise converted into money and redeemable before the sale or conversion, except if the transfer is for the benefit of creditors who accept it in full satisfaction of debts owed to them; or


	(c)	any transfer, assignment or disposition of any estate or interest in property wholly or partly in Victoria that is apparently absolute but intended only as a security; or
	(d)	an instrument that, on the deposit of documents of title, authority to control title or a pledge to provide that control, to property wholly or partly in Victoria becomes a mortgage or evidences the terms of a mortgage.
	150	What is an advance?

	151	Who is liable to pay the duty?
The person liable to pay mortgage duty is the mortgagor or the person who gives the mortgage.
	152	When does a liability arise?
	(1)	A mortgage is liable to duty on the date of its first execution.
	(2)	A mortgage is liable to duty on the making of an advance or further advance by which the amount secured by the mortgage exceeds the amount secured by it at the date a liability to duty last arose in respect of it under this or a corresponding Act.
	(3)	An instrument of security that does not affect property in Victoria at the date of first execution but that affects land in Victoria at any time within 12 months after that date becomes liable to duty as a mortgage on the date on which it first affects the land, unless it is duly stamped under a corresponding Act.
	(4)	An instrument that, on the deposit of documents of title, authority to control title or a pledge to provide that control, to property in Victoria, becomes a mortgage or evidences the terms of a mortgage is liable to duty as a mortgage on the deposit of the documents or instruments or the provision of authority to control title or a pledge to provide such control.
	(5)	A reference in subsection (3) to land does not include a reference to an interest in land that is held by way of security.
	153	When must duty be paid?
A tax default does not occur for the purposes of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 if duty is paid within 3 months after the liability to pay the duty arises.
	154	How is mortgage duty charged?
	(1)	The amount of duty chargeable on a mortgage is determined by the amount secured by it as calculated under Part 2.
	(2)	The amount of duty is-
	(a)	$4 if no amount is secured by the mortgage or if the amount secured is not more than $10 000; or
	(b)	if the amount secured by the mortgage exceeds $10 000, $4 for the first $10 000 and $0.80 for every $200, or part, by which the amount secured exceeds $10 000.
	(3)	The amount of duty chargeable on a mortgage in respect of an advance or further advance is-

	(b)	the amount of duty applicable as provided in subsection (2).
	155	Extent mortgage is enforceable
	(1)	A mortgage or mortgage package on which duty is imposed under this Act or a corresponding Act is enforceable only to the extent of the amount secured by the mortgage or mortgage package in respect of which duty has been paid under this Act or a corresponding Act.


	(2)	Subsection (1) does not apply if the property affected by a mortgage or mortgage package (secured property) is partly in and partly outside Victoria if-
	(a)	duty has been paid on the total advances under the mortgage or mortgage package when the mortgage duty paid is taken with the duty paid under a corresponding Act; and
	(b)	the proportion of secured property in Victoria used to determine mortgage duty liability is-
	(i)	based on a referrable point for the dutiable proportion of the mortgage; and
	(ii)	not incorrect by more than 5%.
	156	Where is property located?

PART 2-CALCULATING THE AMOUNT SECURED BY A MORTGAGE
	157	Secured amount
	(1)	A mortgage is chargeable with duty assessed on the amount of advances actually secured by it and recoverable under it.
	(2)	If duty of $4 is paid or taken to be paid in respect of a mortgage, the mortgage is taken to be stamped in respect of an amount of advances of $10 000.
	(3)	For the purpose of subsection (1), if-
	(a)	a mortgage has been duly stamped for an amount of advances secured by the mortgage; and
	(b)	a further advance secured by the mortgage is made; and
	(c)	the total amount of advances secured by the mortgage exceeds the amount for which the mortgage has been duly stamped-
the amount of advances secured by the mortgage is the amount by which the amount of advances secured by the mortgage exceeds the amount for which the mortgage has been duly stamped.
	(4)	If several mortgages over the same property are executed to secure the same advance-
	(a)	only one is chargeable with duty under this Chapter; and
	(b)	the Commissioner may denote the payment of the duty on the other mortgages.
	(5)	If the duty chargeable on a mortgage depends on duty paid on another instrument, the Commissioner may denote the payment of the duty so paid on the mortgage.
	158	Contingent liabilities
	(1)	A mortgage used or capable of being used, whether directly or indirectly, to recover the whole or any part of an amount contingently payable in connection with an advance-
	(a)	by a guarantor or indemnifying party under a guarantee or indemnity; or
	(b)	by another party under another instrument of a different kind-
is chargeable with duty as if the whole or part of the amount of the contingent liability secured by the mortgage were a separate advance secured by the mortgage.
	(2)	A reference in subsection (1) to a contingent liability is a reference to a contingent liability limited to the amount of any advance by a party referred to in subsection (1) and does not include a reference to any other kind of contingent liability.
	(3)	This section-
	(a)	does not apply if the Commissioner is satisfied that there is no connection between the mortgage and any advance by any party to the arrangements;
	(b)	does not require duty to be paid more than once in respect of an advance.
	159	Mortgages over property not wholly within Victoria
	(1)	Duty chargeable in respect of a mortgage over property that is partly within Victoria and partly outside Victoria is to be assessed as if the amount secured by it were only the dutiable proportion.


	(2)	The dutiable proportion is to be calculated in accordance with the following formula-

where-
	DP	is the dutiable proportion;
	AS	is the amount secured by the mortgage on which duty is charged at the liability date;
	V	is the value of the property in Victoria affected by the mortgage;
	T	is the value of all property affected by the mortgage, excluding property within a Territory or outside Australia
	(3)	The dutiable proportion is to be calculated by reference to the values of the properties according to any referrable point specified in subsection (4).
	(4)	A referrable point is any of the following prepared within 12 months preceding the liability date-
	(a)	an independent valuation of the secured property;
	(b)	a statement of the mortgagee based on information obtained by the mortgagee in determining to make the advance to the mortgagor;
	(c)	property valuations used by the mortgagor in preparing an annual return to be lodged under the Corporations Act;

	(d)	financial reports of the mortgagor certified by an independent auditor as presenting a true and fair view of the company's financial position;
	(e)	agreed valuations for property that form the basis of policies of insurance of the mortgagor;
	(f)	any other approved method.
	(5)	If there are 2 or more referrable points in relation to a mortgage, the referrable point is the later or latest of those referrable points.
	(6)	The referrable point is the same referrable point used or to be used to determine liability to duty at the liability date under a corresponding Act.
	(7)	Evidence of the location and percentage value of any property is to be made by either party to the mortgage by way of a statement in the approved form.
	(8)	A mortgage or a statement made under subsection (7) may be endorsed with duty on the basis of evidence contained in the statement.
	(9)	If a statement is endorsed under subsection (8), the mortgage may be endorsed at any time-
	(a)	as being stamped to the amount evidenced by the duty paid on the statement; and
	(b)	by showing-
	(i)	the percentage of the property in Victoria securing the advance; and

	(ii)	the total amount secured by the mortgage.





	160	Advances secured by mortgage package
	(1)	If-
	(a)	at a liability date, 2 or more security instruments secure or partly secure the same money; and
	(b)	at least one of the instruments is a security affecting property wholly or partly outside Victoria; and
	(c)	at least one of the instruments is a mortgage-
the instruments are known as a mortgage package.
	(2)	Also, a mortgage package may include-
	(a)	a mortgage executed after the liability date if the Commissioner is satisfied that the mortgage was intended to be part of the package; and
	(b)	a mortgage previously collateral to an earlier advance under some or all of the other mortgages in the package.
	(3)	Mortgage duty must be assessed in accordance with the Part on the mortgage package as if the instruments comprising the mortgage package were one mortgage first executed on the day the last instrument to be executed was executed.
	(4)	If 2 or more mortgages over property within Victoria form part of the security for a mortgage package, one of those mortgages must be stamped with the mortgage duty paid in Victoria for the mortgage package and the other mortgages must be stamped as collateral mortgages.

	(5)	Evidence of the location and percentage value of any property is to be made by either party to the mortgage by way of the statement referred to in section 159(7).
	(6)	If a person makes an application for the stamping of a mortgage referred to in subsection (1) and one or more of the other intended mortgages in the mortgage package has not yet been executed, the executed mortgage, until all the intended mortgages are executed, when stamped is security only for that amount of the advance to which the proportion of the property secured by all the executed mortgages bears to the total of the property expressed to secure the advance.
	(7)	The Commissioner may endorse the executed mortgage to indicate the proportion of the advance secured by the mortgage pending the execution of the other intended mortgages.
	(8)	If a mortgage secures the same advance as a mortgage package in respect of which duty has been paid under this Chapter and the mortgage is not part of a mortgage package, the mortgage is taken to be a collateral mortgage in respect of that advance.
	161	Stamping before advance
	(1)	A mortgage may be stamped before an advance whether or not an earlier advance has been made.

	(2)	A mortgage referred to in section 159 or 160 may be stamped to secure any amount exceeding that to which it is already stamped based on the dutiable proportion at the time of stamping.



	(3)	A mortgage stamped under subsection (2) is-
	(a)	duly stamped; and
	(b)	not required to be stamped in accordance with section 159 again until an advance brings the total amount secured above the amount to which it is already stamped.
	(4)	Section 160(6) applies to a mortgage package stamped before an advance.

	162	Security
	(1)	A stamped mortgage or a collateral mortgage that was, but is no longer, part of the same mortgage package and no longer secures the same money secured by that package is not security for any other money unless duty in respect of the other money has been paid.
	(2)	The withdrawal of a mortgage from a mortgage package will not affect the amount to which the remaining mortgage or mortgages are security for.
	163	Exchange of information
The Commissioner may provide information relating to any statement in respect of any mortgage package or mortgage referred to in section 159(1) to any person the Commissioner considers is connected with the administration of this Chapter or the corresponding provisions of a corresponding Act.





	164	Collection of duty and endorsement of instruments
The Commissioner, or a person authorised by the Commissioner, may-
	(a)	collect any duty payable under this Chapter; and
	(b)	endorse mortgages with a stamp showing-
	(i)	the percentage of property in Victoria securing the advance; and

	(ii)	the total amount secured by the mortgage.
	165	Collateral securities
	(1)	Mortgage duty is not chargeable in respect of that part of an amount secured by a collateral mortgage that is secured by-
	(a)	a mortgage or security instrument that has been duly stamped under this Act or a corresponding Act; or
	(b)	a mortgage package that has been duly stamped under section 160 or a corresponding Act.
	(2)	A collateral mortgage that no longer secures an amount secured by a mortgage, instrument or mortgage package mentioned in subsection (1) is not security for another advance unless mortgage duty for the amount of the other advance is paid.


PART 3-DUTY CONCESSIONS
	166	Refinancing of loans
	(1)	In this section-
refinancing mortgage means a mortgage that secures the amount of the balance outstanding immediately before the execution of that mortgage under an earlier mortgage to the same borrower duly stamped under this or a corresponding Act (whether over the same property or a property previously owned by the borrower) that is discharged or to be discharged as part of the arrangements for the new mortgage.
	(2)	For the purposes of subsection (1), mortgages are created to secure an advance to the same borrower if, either directly by the mortgages themselves or indirectly through one or more collateral arrangements, the same person obtains the advances secured by them.
	(3)	A refinancing mortgage is taken to have been stamped with ad valorem duty as a mortgage in respect of the amount required to discharge the earlier mortgage (being an amount in relation to which the earlier mortgage was duly stamped), except as provided by subsection (5).
	(4)	If an advance is refinanced by more than one lender, so that mortgages given to the lenders together secure the balance outstanding under an earlier mortgage, the definition of refinancing mortgage in subsection (1) is to be construed as though-
	(a)	the reference to a mortgage securing the outstanding balance were a reference to the aggregate of such mortgages; and
	(b)	each lender were the holder of a refinancing mortgage.
	(5)	If, as provided by subsection (4), each of a number of lenders is the holder of a refinancing mortgage, a refinancing mortgage held by each lender is taken to have been duly stamped with ad valorem duty as a mortgage in respect of an amount equal to the same proportion of the amount required to discharge the earlier mortgage as the amount secured by that mortgage bears to the total amount secured by the refinancing mortgages held by all the lenders.
	(6)	If each of 2 or more refinancing mortgages severally secures the same advance-
	(a)	the provisions of subsection (3) or (5), as the case may be, apply to such one of the mortgages as the Commissioner determines; and
	(b)	no duty is chargeable in respect of any of the others (insofar as it is a refinancing mortgage) but the Commissioner may denote any of them in the approved manner.
	(7)	For the purposes of section 165-
	(a)	a refinancing mortgage that is taken, by the operation of subsection (3) or (5), to be duly stamped is in either case a stamped mortgage; and
	(b)	duty is taken to have been paid on it to the extent provided by whichever of those subsections applies.
	(8)	Duty at the rate of $0.80 per $200 or part of $200 is payable on the amount by which the advance made under a refinancing mortgage (not being a mortgage on which, by virtue of subsection (6)(b), no duty is chargeable) exceeds-
	(a)	the amount required to discharge the earlier mortgage; or
	(b)	the proportion of that amount referred to in subsection (5), in the case of a refinancing to which subsection (4) applies.
	(9)	If the number of original borrowers is reduced, the remaining borrower or borrowers is or are taken to be the same borrower or the same person for the purposes of subsection (1) or (2).
	167	Eligible mortgages under concession schemes
	(1)	Subject to this section, no duty is chargeable under this Chapter on an eligible mortgage.
	(2)	An eligible mortgage is-
	(a)	a mortgage given by an eligible pensioner or an eligible first home owner securing an advance used or proposed to be used-
	(i)	for the purchase of an estate in fee simple in land, if he or she is entitled under Division 5 of Part 5 of Chapter 2 to an exemption or concession from duty on the transfer of the land; or
	(ii)	for the construction of a dwelling on that land; or
	(b)	a re-financing mortgage (within the meaning of section 166) in respect of a mortgage referred to in paragraph (a).
	(3)	This section applies only to that part of the amount secured by an eligible mortgage that is used or proposed to be used for the purpose of purchasing the land or the construction of a dwelling on the land.
	(4)	For the purposes of assessing duty in respect of any further advances secured by an eligible mortgage, duty is taken to have been paid on the part of the amount secured that is referred to in subsection (3).
	(5)	If a person-
	(a)	represents to a tax officer that a mortgage is not chargeable with duty, or is chargeable with less duty, because of this section; and
	(b)	is convicted of an offence against section 57 of the Taxation Administration Act 1997 as a consequence-
the person is liable, by way of further penalty, to pay an amount equal to double the amount of duty that, but for the offence, would have been payable, less any amount of duty that the person did pay.
	(6)	The penalty in subsection (5) is in addition to any penalty tax or interest that may be payable under the Taxation Administration Act 1997.



PART 4-EXEMPTIONS


	168	Exempt mortgages and supporting instruments
	(1)	This Chapter does not apply to-
	(a)	a mortgage executed before 4 January 1965; or
	(b)	a mortgage that is not chargeable with duty under this Act.
