	(b)	expressions used in any instrument so made have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation as in force from time to time; and
	(c)	any instrument so made is to be read and construed subject to the enabling legislation as in force from time to time, and so as not to exceed the power of the authority.
	(2)	If any instrument so made would, but for this subsection, be construed as being in excess of the authority's power, it is to be taken to be a valid instrument to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.

	(5)	An instrument to which this section applies must be notified in the Gazette and, if the instrument is not so notified by being published in full in the Gazette, a notice in the Gazette of the instrument's having been made, and of the place or places where copies of it can be purchased, is sufficient compliance with that requirement.
	(6)	If a notice of the making of an instrument is published in accordance with subsection (5), copies of the instrument must, at the time of publication of the notice or as soon as practicable thereafter, be made available for purchase at the place, or at each of the places, specified in the notice.

	(11)	Unless the law otherwise provides, Part 5 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, other than sections 38, 39, 40 and 44, applies in relation to an instrument to which this section applies as if:
