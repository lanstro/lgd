	(1)	An Australian lawyer may apply to the Board for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if eligible to do so.

	(i)	the lawyer reasonably expects to be engaged in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction during the currency of the certificate or renewal applied for; or
	(ii)	if subparagraph (i) does not apply to the lawyer or it is not reasonably practicable to determine whether it applies to the lawyer-the lawyer's place of residence in Australia is this jurisdiction or the lawyer does not have a place of residence in Australia; or
	(b)	in the case of a lawyer who is an Australian legal practitioner at the time of making the application-
	(i)	the jurisdiction in which the lawyer engages in legal practice solely or principally is this jurisdiction; or

	(iii)	the lawyer reasonably expects to be engaged in legal practice solely or principally in this jurisdiction during the currency of the certificate or renewal applied for; or
	(iv)	if subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) does not apply to the lawyer or it is not reasonably practicable to determine whether subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) applies to the lawyer-the lawyer's place of residence in Australia is this jurisdiction or the lawyer does not have a place of residence in Australia.




	(3)	For the purposes of subsection (2)(b), the jurisdiction in which an Australian lawyer engages in legal practice principally is to be decided by reference to the lawyer's legal practice during the certificate period current at the time-

	(b)	in the case of a late application-the application should have been made.
	(3A)	An Australian lawyer is not eligible to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate in respect of a financial year if the lawyer would also be the holder of another Australian practising certificate for that year, but this subsection does not limit the factors determining ineligibility to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate.

Accordingly, an Australian lawyer who is engaged or expects to be engaged in legal practice principally in a foreign country is nevertheless eligible to apply for the grant or renewal of a local practising certificate if the lawyer otherwise meets the requirements of this section.
Note
The purpose of this subsection is to deal with a case where a person practises both in Australia and overseas.  In that case, overseas practice is to be disregarded (even if it forms the principal portion of the person's overall practice), so that eligibility is determined by reference only to the person's practice in Australia.

	(1B)	The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the use of benchmark rates of interest and, in particular, for or with respect to permitting, regulating or preventing the use of particular benchmark rates or particular kinds of benchmark rates.

	(3)	A law practice is taken to have complied with the requirement to disclose the details referred to in subsection (1)(b)(i), (ia) and (ii), (h), (j), (k) and (m) if it provides a written statement in or to the effect of a form prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection at the same time as the other details are disclosed as required by this section.
	(4)	A regulation prescribing a form for the purposes of subsection (3) may provide for the form to refer to fact sheets or other documents (whether as current at the time the regulation commences or any earlier time or as in force for the time being) that contain details of the kind referred to in that subsection.
	(5)	The regulation may-
	(a)	require the Commissioner to produce and maintain fact sheets or other documents that are referred to in the form and to make them available on the Internet; and

	(2)	A law practice retained or to be retained on behalf of a client by another law practice is not required to make disclosure to the client under section 3.4.9, but must disclose to the other law practice the information necessary for the other law practice to comply with subsection (1).
	(3)	This section does not apply if the first law practice ceases to act for the client in the matter when the other law practice is retained.
Note
An example of the operation of this section is where a barrister is retained by a firm of solicitors on behalf of a client of the firm.  The barrister must disclose to the firm details of the barrister's legal costs and billing arrangements, and the firm must disclose those details to the client.  The barrister is not required to make a disclosure directly to the client.

	(1)	Disclosure under section 3.4.9 or 3.4.10(1) is not required to be made in any of the following circumstances-

	(iii)	a principal of the law practice decides on reasonable grounds that, having regard to the nature of the previous disclosures and the relevant circumstances, the further disclosure is not warranted;

	(i)	a law practice or an Australian legal practitioner; or

	(iv)	a liquidator, administrator or receiver (as respectively referred to in that Act); or

	(viii)	a Minister of the Crown in right of a jurisdiction or the Commonwealth acting in his or her capacity as such, or a government department or public authority of a jurisdiction or the Commonwealth;
	(d)	if the legal costs or the basis on which they will be calculated have or has been agreed as a result of a tender process;
	(e)	if the client will not be required to pay the legal costs or they will not otherwise be recovered by the law practice;
Note
For instance, disclosure would not be required where the law practice acts in the matter on a pro bono basis.
	(f)	in any circumstances prescribed by the regulations.
	(2)	Despite subsection (1)(a), if a law practice becomes aware that the total legal costs are likely to exceed $750 (exclusive of GST) or the prescribed amount (whichever is higher), the law practice must disclose the matters in section 3.4.9 or 3.4.10 (as the case requires) to the client as soon as practicable.
	(3)	A law practice must ensure that a written record of a principal's decision that further disclosure is not warranted as mentioned in subsection (1)(b) is made and kept with the files relating to the matter concerned.
	(4)	The reaching of a decision referred to in subsection (3) otherwise than on reasonable grounds is capable of constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct on the part of the principal.

	(5)	Nothing in this section affects or takes away from any client's right-
	(a)	to progress reports in accordance with section 3.4.18;
	(b)	to obtain reasonable information from the law practice in relation to any of the matters specified in section 3.4.9;

	(a)	a reasonable estimate of the amount of legal costs payable by the client if the matter is settled (including any legal costs of another party that the client is to pay); and
	(b)	a reasonable estimate of any contributions towards those costs likely to be received from another party.
	(2)	A law practice retained on behalf of a client by another law practice is not required to make a disclosure to the client under subsection (1) if the other law practice makes the disclosure to the client before the settlement is executed.



	3.4.14	Additional disclosure-uplift fees


	(1)	If a costs agreement involves an uplift fee, the law practice must disclose to the client in writing, before entering the agreement, the law practice's usual fees, the uplift fee (or the basis of calculation of the uplift fee) and reasons why the uplift fee is warranted.
	(2)	A law practice is not required to make a disclosure under subsection (1) to a sophisticated client.

	3.4.16	Ongoing obligation to disclose
A law practice must, in writing, disclose to a client any substantial change to anything included in a disclosure already made under this Division as soon as is reasonably practicable after the law practice becomes aware of that change.

	3.4.17	Effect of failure to disclose
	(1)	If a law practice does not disclose to a client or an associated third party payer anything required by this Division to be disclosed, the client or associated third party payer (as the case may be) need not pay the legal costs unless they have been reviewed under Division 7.
Note
Under section 3.4.45, the costs of a review in these circumstances are generally payable by the law practice.
	(2)	A law practice that does not disclose to a client or an associated third party payer anything required by this Division to be disclosed may not maintain proceedings against the client or associated third party payer (as the case may be) for the recovery of legal costs unless the costs have been reviewed under Division 7.
	(3)	If a law practice does not disclose to a client or an associated third party payer anything required by this Division to be disclosed and the client or associated third party payer has entered into a costs agreement with the law practice, the client or associated third party payer may also apply under section 3.4.32 for the costs agreement to be set aside.
	(4)	If a law practice does not disclose to a client or an associated third party payer anything required by this Division to be disclosed, then, on a review of the relevant legal costs, the amount of the costs may be reduced by an amount considered by the Costs Court to be proportionate to the seriousness of the failure to disclose.
	(5)	If a law practice retains another law practice on behalf of a client and the first law practice fails to disclose something to the client solely because the retained law practice failed to disclose relevant information to the first law practice as required by section 3.4.10(2), then subsections (1) to (4)-
	(a)	do not apply to the legal costs owing to the first law practice on account of legal services provided by it, to the extent that the non-disclosure by the first law practice was caused by the failure of the retained law practice to disclose the relevant information; and
	(b)	do apply to the legal costs owing to the retained law practice.
	(5A)	In a matter involving both a client and an associated third party payer where disclosure has been made to one of them but not the other-
	(a)	subsection (1) does not affect the liability of the one to whom disclosure was made to pay the legal costs; and
	(b)	subsection (2) does not prevent proceedings being maintained against the one to whom the disclosure was made for the recovery of those legal costs.
	(6)	Failure by a law practice to comply with this Division is capable of constituting unsatisfactory professional conduct or professional misconduct on the part of any Australian legal practitioner or Australian-registered foreign lawyer involved in the failure.
	(7)	Subsections (1) and (2) do not apply if the legal costs are or have been the subject of a civil complaint under Chapter 4.
	3.4.18	Progress reports
	(1)	A law practice must give a client, on reasonable request-
	(a)	a written report of the progress of the matter in which the law practice is retained; and
	(b)	a written report of the legal costs incurred by the client to date, or since the last bill (if any), in the matter.
	(2)	A law practice may charge a client a reasonable amount for a report under subsection (1)(a) but must not charge a client for a report under subsection (1)(b).
	(3)	A law practice retained on behalf of a client by another law practice is not required to give a report to the client under subsection (1), but must disclose to the other law practice any information necessary for the other law practice to comply with that subsection.
	(4)	Subsection (3) does not apply if the other law practice ceases to act for the client in the matter when the law practice is retained.
	3.4.18A	Disclosure to associated third party payers
	(1)	If a law practice is required to make a disclosure to a client of the practice under this Division, the practice must, in accordance with subsections (2) and (3), also make the same disclosure to any associated third party payer for the client, but only to the extent that the details or matters disclosed are relevant to the associated third party payer and relate to costs that are payable by the associated third party payer in respect of legal services provided to the client.
	(2)	A disclosure under subsection (1) must be made in writing-
	(a)	at the time the disclosure to the client is required under this Division; or
	(b)	if the law practice only afterwards becomes aware of the legal obligation of the associated third party payer to pay legal costs of the client-as soon as practicable after the practice became aware of the obligation.
	(3)	Section 3.4.15 applies to a disclosure to an associated third party payer under subsection (1) in the same way as it applies to a client.
	(4)	An associated third party payer for a client of a law practice has the same right as the client to obtain reports under section 3.4.18(1)(b) of legal costs incurred by the client, but only to the extent that the costs are payable by the associated third party payer in respect of legal services provided to the client, and the law practice must comply with that section accordingly.
Division 4-Legal costs generally
	3.4.19	On what basis are legal costs recoverable?
Subject to Division 2, legal costs are recoverable-
	(a)	under a costs agreement made in accordance with Division 5 or the corresponding provisions of a corresponding law; or
	(b)	if paragraph (a) does not apply, in accordance with an applicable practitioner remuneration order or scale of costs; or
	(c)	if neither paragraph (a) nor (b) applies, according to the fair and reasonable value of the legal services provided.

	(4)	In the case of a default involving trust property received in Australia, or received outside Australia and brought to Australia, the relevant jurisdiction for the associate is the associate's home jurisdiction.
Note
Section 3.6.31 may treat the default as consisting of two or more defaults for the purpose of determining the liability of the Fidelity Fund.
	3.6.5	Defaults to which this Part applies
	(1)	This Part applies to-
	(a)	a default of a law practice arising from or constituted by an act or omission of one or more associates of the practice, if this jurisdiction is the relevant jurisdiction for the only associate or one or more of the associates involved; or

	(2)	It is immaterial where the default occurs.

	(a)	a managed investment scheme undertaken by the practice; or

	(3)	Without limiting subsection (1) or (2), this Part does not apply to a default of a law practice to the extent that the default occurs in relation to money or property that is entrusted to or held by the practice for investment purposes, whether on its own account or as agent, unless-
	(a)	the money or property was entrusted to or held by the practice-
	(i)	in the ordinary course of legal practice; and
	(ii)	primarily in connection with the provision of legal services to or at the direction of the client; and
	(b)	the investment is or is to be made-
	(i)	in the ordinary course of legal practice; and
	(ii)	for the ancillary purpose of maintaining or enhancing the value of the money or property pending completion of the matter or further stages of the matter or pending payment or delivery of the money or property to or at the direction of the client.
