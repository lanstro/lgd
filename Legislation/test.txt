Part 1—Preliminary
  
1  Short title
		This Act may be cited as the Acts Interpretation Act 1901.
1A  Simplified outline
		The following is a simplified outline of this Act:
Overview
This Act is like a dictionary and manual to use when reading and interpreting Commonwealth Acts and instruments made under Commonwealth Acts.
The definitions and many of the interpretation rules are aimed at making Commonwealth legislation shorter, less complex and more consistent in operation.
A provision of this Act is subject to a contrary intention in other Commonwealth legislation.
Structure
Part 1 provides that this Act applies to all Acts. This Act also applies to legislative instruments and other instruments made under an Act (see subsection 13(1) of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and subsection 46(1) of this Act).
Part 2 contains definitions that apply across all Commonwealth legislation (for example, Australian citizen, business day, document and month).
Part 3 deals with the commencement of Commonwealth Acts. For example, section 4 allows certain powers to be exercised (like the making of appointments) between the enactment and commencement of an Act.
Part 4 deals with the amendment, repeal and expiry of Commonwealth legislation. For example, section 7 provides that the repeal of an Act does not affect any rights accrued under the Act, or any legal proceedings instituted, before the repeal.
Part 5 contains various rules for interpreting Commonwealth legislation, including:
	(a)	section 15A (about interpreting an Act subject to the Constitution); and
	(b)	section 15AA (which provides for interpreting an Act in a way that best achieves the purpose or object of the Act); and
	(c)	section 15AB (about using material that is not part of an Act (like explanatory memorandums and second reading speeches) in interpreting an Act); and
	(d)	sections 19 to 19C (which deal with references to Ministers, Departments and Secretaries of Departments and with administrative changes in the operation of the Commonwealth Government).
Part 6 deals with the service of documents on persons.
Part 7 contains rules about exercising powers and performing functions and duties under Commonwealth legislation, including:
	(a)	subsection 33(3) (which provides that a power to make an instrument includes the power to vary or revoke the instrument); and
	(b)	section 33A (about acting appointments); and
	(c)	sections 34AA, 34AB and 34A (about delegating powers, functions and duties).
Part 8 deals with the calculation of distance, time and age.
Part 9 deals with the citation of Acts.
Part 10 deals with nonlegislative instruments. For example, it provides that this Act applies to those instruments and that expressions in those instruments have the same meaning as in the enabling legislation.
Part 11 contains a regulationmaking power.

		Every Act shall be read and construed subject to the Constitution, and so as not to exceed the legislative power of the Commonwealth, to the intent that where any enactment thereof would, but for this section, have been construed as being in excess of that power, it shall nevertheless be a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of that power.
15AA  Interpretation best achieving Act’s purpose or object
		In interpreting a provision of an Act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose or object of the Act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act) is to be preferred to each other interpretation.
15AB  Use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an Act
	(1)	Subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, if any material not forming part of the Act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material:
	(a)	to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; or
	(b)	to determine the meaning of the provision when:
	(i)	the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or
	(ii)	the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.
	(2)	Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the material that may be considered in accordance with that subsection in the interpretation of a provision of an Act includes:
	(a)	all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer;
	(b)	any relevant report of a Royal Commission, Law Reform Commission, committee of inquiry or other similar body that was laid before either House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;
	(c)	any relevant report of a committee of the Parliament or of either House of the Parliament that was made to the Parliament or that House of the Parliament before the time when the provision was enacted;
	(d)	any treaty or other international agreement that is referred to in the Act;
	(e)	any explanatory memorandum relating to the Bill containing the provision, or any other relevant document, that was laid before, or furnished to the members of, either House of the Parliament by a Minister before the time when the provision was enacted;
	(f)	the speech made to a House of the Parliament by a Minister on the occasion of the moving by that Minister of a motion that the Bill containing the provision be read a second time in that House;
	(g)	any document (whether or not a document to which a preceding paragraph applies) that is declared by the Act to be a relevant document for the purposes of this section; and
	(h)	any relevant material in the Journals of the Senate, in the Votes and Proceedings of the House of Representatives or in any official record of debates in the Parliament or either House of the Parliament.
	(3)	In determining whether consideration should be given to any material in accordance with subsection (1), or in considering the weight to be given to any such material, regard shall be had, in addition to any other relevant matters, to:
	(a)	the desirability of persons being able to rely on the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; and
	(b)	the need to avoid prolonging legal or other proceedings without compensating advantage.
15AC  Changes to style not to affect meaning
		Where:
	(a)	an Act has expressed an idea in a particular form of words; and
	(b)	a later Act appears to have expressed the same idea in a different form of words for the purpose of using a clearer style;
the ideas shall not be taken to be different merely because different forms of words were used.
15AD  Examples
		If an Act includes an example of the operation of a provision:
	(a)	the example is not exhaustive; and
	(b)	the example may extend the operation of the provision.
15AE  Legislative instruments etc.
Instruments that are described as legislative instruments
	(1)	If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision:
	(a)	must be in writing; and
	(b)	is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
	(2)	However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is or must be of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).
Instruments that are described as not being legislative instruments
	(3)	If a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made, then an instrument made under that provision is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003.
	(4)	However, the fact that a provision of a law requires or permits an instrument that is described as not being a legislative instrument to be made does not imply that an instrument made under that provision is not, or must not be, of legislative character (within the ordinary meaning of that term).
No inference to be drawn from express statements
	(5)	In determining whether an instrument made under a provision of a law is a legislative instrument for the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, no inference may be drawn from the fact that an instrument made under another provision of that or any other law is described as a legislative instrument, or as not being a legislative instrument.
Example:	In determining whether a Ministerial direction under a provision is a legislative instrument, no inference may be drawn from the fact that a Ministerial direction under another provision is described as being a legislative instrument.
Definition
	(6)	In this section:
law means an Act or regulations or any other instrument made under an Act.
15B  Application of Acts in coastal sea

	(6)	If a notice of the making of an instrument is published in accordance with subsection (5), copies of the instrument must, at the time of publication of the notice or as soon as practicable thereafter, be made available for purchase at the place, or at each of the places, specified in the notice.
